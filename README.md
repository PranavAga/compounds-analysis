_S25: Computational Psycholinguistics_

# Investigating Compounds and their Semantic Representations
## Research Question
How well do contextualized representations align with human semantic judgements [1](#references "Refernces") in processing
compound words with respect to psycholinguistics? What factors among predictability, frequency and
association strength [3](#references "Refernces") in processing are better predictor of the psycholinguistic measures defined.
## Dataset
Psycholinguistic dataset from Juhasz et al. (2015) [2](#references "Refernces") in processing containing 628 lexicalized English compounds
annotated for LMD and ST.

## The Team
- Swarang Joshi
- Pranav Agarwal
