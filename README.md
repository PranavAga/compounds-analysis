# Investigating Compounds and their Semantic Representations
## Research Question
How well do contextualized representations align with human semantic judgements [1](#references "References") in processing compound words with respect to psycholinguistics? What factors among predictability, frequency and association strength in processing are better predictor of the psycholinguistic measures defined. 
<!-- TODO: add about analysis -->
## Dataset
Psycholinguistic dataset from Juhasz et al. (2015) [2](#references "References") in processing containing 628 lexicalized English compounds
annotated for LMD and ST.

We use Edinburgh Associative Thesaurus (EAT) for word associations [3](#references "References") and LaDEC: Large database of English compounds [4](#references "References") for predictability and BNC word frequency.
